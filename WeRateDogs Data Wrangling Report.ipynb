I parsed those JSON responses to get direct retweet counts and likes for each tweet. There is a readily available data for dog breed prediction using image classification. I downloaded that dataset.\n"

    "### Data quality issues\n",
    "* My primary concern was about duplicated data, missing data and inappropriate data types. There was no duplicated data. I changed data type of `tweet_id` to string. I converted data type of timestamp and retweeted_status_timestamp to datetime.\n",
    "* Further analysis using value_counts() method on `source` column caught my attention. It has only 4 distinct sources of tweets. IPhone, Vine, Web client and TwetDeck. I cleaned that attribute, so that we can observe source easily.\n",
    "* Attributes `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp` has missing values more than 92%. So, I decided to drop those attributes.\n",
    "* By conducting visual analysis, I figured out dog names have very strange names like a, an, the, by, not, o, officially, all, just, very, one, quiet, mad, this, my. I replaced such names by None.\n",
    "* I combined `doggo`, `floofer`, `puppper`, `puppo` atteributes into one attribute called `age_category`. 14 records have more than one fields set. I decided to remove such records as by doing so we will not loose large amount of data. Also, I converted type of `age_category` attribute to category which will reduce memory foorprint.\n",
    "* With analysis of `rating_denominator` and `rating_numerator` I got 23 records with `rating_denominator` less than 10. I dropped those records, as they are very less compared to our dataset size. `rating_numerator` also have values less than 10 and some outlier on right tail. But I decided to leave them as it is. May be in future we can get more insight to handle it."
